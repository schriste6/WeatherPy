# Vacation, Weather, and Google Maps
## A combination for happy travelers
### The PlanMyTrip app has gone through iterations to  integrate recommendations from Beta testers.  
1. Add the current weather description (clear, cloudy, etc) to the weather data already developed.
2. Add an input statement to filter the data for traveler's preferences (preferred temperatures; min and max.
   * This will narrow the list of potential travel destinations and include nearby hotels.  
4. Add a travel route feature between selected cities that includes a marker layer map.
